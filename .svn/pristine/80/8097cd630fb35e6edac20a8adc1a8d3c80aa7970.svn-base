# SeerLord AI

SeerLord AI is a modular AI platform built on a **Micro-Kernel + Plugin Architecture**. It leverages LangGraph for powerful agent orchestration and supports flexible plugin extensions, designed to provide developers with an efficient and scalable framework for AI application development.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Micro-Kernel Architecture**: A lightweight and stable core system responsible for lifecycle management, context sharing, and resource scheduling.
- **Plugin System**: All business capabilities (such as news reporting, tutorial generation, financial analysis, etc.) are implemented via plugins, enabling plug-and-play functionality.
- **Agent Orchestration (LangGraph)**: Utilizes LangGraph to build complex stateful multi-agent workflows.
- **MCP Support**: Integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized context and tool interactions.
- **High-Performance Backend**: An asynchronous backend built with FastAPI, supporting SSE streaming responses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (AsyncPG)
- **Utilities**: Pydantic, Loguru, SSE-Starlette
